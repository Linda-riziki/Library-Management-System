Library Management System
Description:
This project is a database management system (DBMS) designed to manage the operations of a library. It includes tables for authors, books, members, and borrow records. The system tracks which books are borrowed, by which members, and when they are due for return.

How to Run/Setup:
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Open MySQL Workbench (or another SQL editor).

Create a new database, for example, CREATE DATABASE LibraryDB;.

Import the library_management_system.sql file into the database 

This will create the tables and insert sample data into the system
